# Work
- I’m @LainShot
- I solve engineering problems for a job using technology whether that is hardware or software.
- I spend more time writing COBOL now, helping creating code to interface legacy systems with there modern replacments that I also help design and implment.
- This can be hard as a system might not of been touched for 30 years and might do a very specfic complex job in industry, that lifes are dependant on.
- This means I have both a legacy skill set (cobol fms vax) and a modern one such as (TypeScript, C++, and intel ASM to name a few)
- I also do a lot of database work both legacy codasyl and modern such a document style databases and mysql databases.
- Most of my work is not on public github. 
- I also have a bunch of other skills that I have picked up in the last 15 years.
- If you need somone to help or fix old systems you can contact me on twitter @LainShot

# Spare Time 
- I also am the creator of @openpug and wirte a lot of the code for that in EJS, TS, and JS with a little bit of Python and C. 
- None of that code is on here either and is stored on our private SCM. If you want to help out with that just contact me.
- I also run all of the infrastructure for openpug and other public services I host, most of the gear for this is spread out between GE and FIN.
- I am currently studying a degree in cyber secuirty, not too sure what I am going to do with that at the moment but hey :D .
- Been desining and creating a single board computer and some DSP solutions for DOLBY HD and DTS-MA decoding mods for old sound processors.
- I sometimes try to sleep but as my co-works ask "why did you commit this at 2am"
- Other than that you will find me building computers or playing games.
