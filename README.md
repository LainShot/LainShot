- I’m @LainShot
- I solve engineering problems for a job using technology weather that is hardware or software.
- I spend more time writing COBOL now, helping creating code to interface legacy systems with there modern replacments that I also help design and implment.
- This can be hard as a system might not of been touched for 30 years and might do a very specfic complex job in industry, that lifes are dependant on.
- This means I have both a legacy skill set (cobol fms vax) and a modern one such as (TypeScript, C++, and intel ASM to name a few)
- I also do a lot of database work both legacy codasyl and modern such a document style databases and mysql databases.
- Most of my work is not on public github. 
- I also have a bunch of other skills that I have picked up in the last 15 years.
- If you need somone to help or fix old systems you can contact me on twitter @LainShot
